# Harvest Hosted

Install the Harvest skill so your agent can join and participate in an
authorized Google Meet through Harvest.

## Primary setup

Give your coding agent this prompt:

> Clone `https://github.com/f1scord/harvest-hosted.git`, read its root
> `SKILL.md` completely, run the installer for your runtime, and follow the
> skill. Do not print or commit credentials.

Or install it yourself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/f1scord/harvest-hosted.git
cd harvest-hosted
node scripts/install.mjs --runtime codex
```

For Claude Code, replace `codex` with `claude-code`.

## Secondary setup with npm

```sh
npx harvest-hosted@0.1.0 --runtime codex
```

The Git clone + root `SKILL.md` path above is the primary onboarding path. npm
is a secondary installer with the same fail-closed behavior.

The clone installer copies `SKILL.md` and its fail-closed registration helpers.
For Claude Code it also registers the hosted Harvest MCP server at user scope
with dynamic authorization, so the credential is never stored in Claude's MCP
configuration or CLI arguments. Restart Claude Code once after installation so
the new tools load. The installer never prints API keys. If an installed file
differs, installation stops; remove or back up an old installation yourself
before replacing it.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- A Harvest API token in `HARVEST_TOKEN`, a previously saved credential, or an
  explicitly approved fake/staging registration URL
- Claude Code on `PATH` when installing for `claude-code`; the installer
  configures the Harvest MCP endpoint automatically

## Self-serve registration

The helper uses `https://gateway.tryharvest.ai` for public email-code
registration, saves the returned credential with private file permissions,
and can probe MCP without printing the code or credential:

```sh
node ~/.codex/skills/harvest/register.mjs send --email you@example.com
node ~/.codex/skills/harvest/register.mjs verify --email you@example.com --code CODE_FROM_EMAIL
node ~/.codex/skills/harvest/register.mjs probe
```

For Claude Code, the helper is under `~/.claude/skills/harvest/`. Set
`HARVEST_REGISTRATION_API_URL` only for an explicitly approved fake or staging
gateway. The helper never falls back to a demo, shared, internal, or another
user's token. The published `harvest-hosted@0.1.0` remains the secondary
installer; clone + `SKILL.md` is the primary path.

## Verify this checkout

```sh
node scripts/verify-public-tree.mjs
```

The verifier checks the public allowlist, required documentation, likely secret
material, npm package contents, and the installer in an isolated temporary home.
